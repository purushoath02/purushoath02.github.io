        <h1>About Me </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a computer science enthusiast with a serious passion for Artificial Intelligence! ðŸ¤– From cracking codes to building cool software, I'm all about making tech do amazing things.

                You'll often find me knee-deep in code, diving into the world of programming languages like it's a thrilling adventure. Whether it's Python, Java, or even a bit of C++, I'm always up for a coding challenge! ðŸ’»
                
                Hackathons? Competitions? You name it, I've probably been there! I love the rush of creativity and collaboration that comes with working on tight deadlines to create something awesome. Plus, it's the perfect opportunity to put my problem-solving skills to the test! ðŸ”¥
                
                But it's not all about the big events. I'm also big on personal projects â€“ you know, those little coding experiments that turn into something unexpectedly cool. They're like my playground for learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in tech.
                
                So yeah, that's me in a nutshell! Always eager to learn, create, and maybe even change the world, one line of code at a time. ðŸ˜‰ Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
